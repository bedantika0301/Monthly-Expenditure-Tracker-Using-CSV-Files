# Monthly-Expenditure-Tracker-Using-CSV-Files
The project is developed using basic Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditional statements, and file handling. CSV files are used to store expense records, including the date, category, amount, and description. The program reads and writes to the CSV file whenever the user adds a new expense or views the monthly summary.
